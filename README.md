# JusticeBot
Justice Bot is an AI-powered chatbot designed to provide legal guidance to prisoners in Indian jails who may not have access to legal resources. The bot assists users in understanding their rights and procedures related to bail, leveraging advanced NLP and AI technologies.

# Overview
Justice Bot integrates cutting-edge AI technologies to provide accurate legal information:

- **Large Language Models (LLMs):** Justice Bot utilizes state-of-the-art large language models like InLegalBERT from Hugging Face. These models are fine-tuned specifically for legal domains, enabling the bot to comprehend and respond to complex legal queries with high accuracy.

- **ChromaDB:** Justice Bot employs ChromaDB, a vector-based database, for efficient storage and retrieval of legal documents. ChromaDB indexes documents based on their semantic content, allowing rapid access to relevant legal information in response to user queries.

- **LegalBERT and InLegalBERT:** These models are pivotal in Justice Bot's ability to interpret legal questions and provide tailored answers. LegalBERT serves as a robust foundation, while InLegalBERT specializes in legal domain-specific question answering, ensuring precise responses to queries regarding Indian legal rights and procedures.

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Justice Bot leverages RAG techniques to enhance response quality. By integrating information retrieval from ChromaDB with generative models, RAG enables the bot to provide contextually relevant and accurate answers to user queries, thereby improving user interaction and satisfaction.

# Architecture
Justice Bot's architecture is structured to seamlessly handle legal queries and deliver accurate responses:

- **Data Retrieval and Preprocessing:** The bot fetches legal documents from various sources, including judicial updates and legal databases, ensuring the information is current and relevant.

- **Question Answering Module:** Powered by InLegalBERT, this module processes user queries, extracts relevant information from indexed documents in ChromaDB, and generates concise answers outlining legal rights or bail procedures.

- **ChromaDB Integration:** Implemented for efficient document indexing and retrieval, ChromaDB optimizes the storage and querying of legal texts based on semantic similarity, enhancing the bot's responsiveness and accuracy.

- **Code Structure:** The project is structured in Python, leveraging libraries such as Hugging Face Transformers for model integration, Chroma for vector store operations, and Flask for handling web requests. The code ensures robust interaction between the AI models and the database, facilitating seamless user interactions and efficient information retrieval.

# Usage
To interact with Justice Bot:

- Input your legal query regarding rights or bail procedures in Indian law.
- Receive detailed responses generated by InLegalBERT, backed by insights from indexed legal documents in ChromaDB.
- Navigate additional resources and legal updates provided by the bot to further understand legal rights and procedures.
